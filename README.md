Comments:
I like the new version and the new color theme.
I'm sorry I couldn't add more comment on the functionalities. It seems that the demo doesn't work on my browser.
I open your demo based on Chrome. And it shows like this. It seems that your page fall into a scrollbar disaster. I stick the screen shot below.
If you couldn't see the picture, find me on Wechat.
